<p><i><span class="smcap">Walt Whitman</span> has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
    by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
    to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
    numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
    brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
    to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
    allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
    proper thing to love them. And in the sect—fairly large and yet
    unusually choice—of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
    found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
    novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of</i> Northanger
    Abbey, <i>its completeness, finish, and</i> entrain, <i>obscure the undoubted
        critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
        of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
        difficulty.</i> Persuasion, <i>relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
        in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
        delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of</i> Mansfield Park <i>is admittedly
        theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{x}" id="pgepubid00005"><a id="page_x" title="{x}"></a></span>
        wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
        Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
        very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
        yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
        others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it.</i> Sense and
    Sensibility <i>has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
        not want them.</i></p>

<p><i>I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
    would, all things considered, be divided between</i> Emma <i>and the present
    book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
    Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
    of vulgarity) would go for</i> Emma. <i>It is the larger, the more varied, the
    more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
    more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
    peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
    Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,
    I, for my part, declare for</i> Pride and Prejudice <i>unhesitatingly. It
    seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
    eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
    in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show
    cause.</i></p>

<p><i>In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
    reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
    when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
    finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
    1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xi}" id="pgepubid00006"><a id="page_xi" title="{xi}"></a></span> this
    combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
    critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
    superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
    possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost
    regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
    could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia
    and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a</i> coup de
    théâtre; <i>it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
        story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
        All the minor passages—the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.
        Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour—fit in after the
        same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the
        hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
        Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
        intrigue of</i> Emma, <i>but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think
        the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen
        always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
        opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
        be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
        natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
        by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
        the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
        aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
        the playwright has ever been laid upon</i> Pride and Prejudice; <i>and I dare
        say that,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xii}" id="pgepubid00007"><a id="page_xii" title="{xii}"></a></span> if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
        garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
        delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would
        certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
        which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
        avail himself, appear at once on the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
    more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
    merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts
    and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
    will sometimes mar those graces—appreciably, though not quite
    consciously—to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built
    novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
    displayed consummate command of dialogue—perhaps the rarest of all
    faculties—would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
    acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the
    ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one
    should put</i> Pride and Prejudice <i>far lower if it did not contain what
    seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her
    faculty of character-creation—masterpieces who may indeed admit John
    Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,
    but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
    superior to them.</i></p>

<p><i>The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
    that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
    express, and at any particular<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xiii}" id="pgepubid00008"><a id="page_xiii" title="{xiii}"></a></span> time likely to be differently
    apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a
    greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of
    the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of
    scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
    obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
    for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in
    Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
    masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
    common subdivisions of quality—demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
    avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a
    certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those
    who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the
    savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness
    of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
    her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much
    protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a
    restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
    roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,
    of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
    nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
    would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
    husband in the</i> Spectator, <i>who describes, with all the gusto and all the
    innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
    at blind-man’s-buff. But another</i> Spectator <i>letter—that of the damsel
    of fourteen who<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xiv}" id="pgepubid00009"><a id="page_xiv" title="{xiv}"></a></span> wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected
    Mentor that “he admires your</i> Spectators <i>mightily”—might have been
    written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the
    days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I
    think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s
    own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
    her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
    English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous
    falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
    snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means
    the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
    beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
    that to seem is not identical with to be—if this be cynicism, then
    every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a
    fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
    a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even
    have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she
    took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
    work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,
    and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she
    was immensely the better for it as an artist.</i></p>

<p><i>In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed
    that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
    combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that
    we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xv}" id="pgepubid00010"><a id="page_xv" title="{xv}"></a></span>
    painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
    term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling
    at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than
    of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should
    myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a
    microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
    littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
    paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
    feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very
    short periods of writing—one of about three years, and another of not
    much more than five—she executed six capital works, and has not left a
    single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her
    composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody
    born in her decade—that of the eighteenth-century
    seventies—independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott
    required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and
    German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an
    English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
    ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
    pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the
    gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
    subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
    Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
    taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost
    touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey
    even in a black one.</i><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xvi}" id="pgepubid00011"><a id="page_xvi" title="{xvi}"></a></span></p>

<p><i>For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
    only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the
    first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
    true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she
    has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes
    the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any
    Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously
    piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get
    none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
    shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the
    myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
    Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book
    only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.
    Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know</i> how <i>Mrs. Bennet would have
    stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back</i>
    himself,” <i>the touch in each case is like that of Swift—“taller by the
        breadth of my nail”—which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with
        just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I
        should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her
        to Addison in others.</i></p>

<p><i>This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
    nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.
    Collins. Mr. Collins is really</i> great; <i>far greater than anything Addison
    ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has
    been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xvii}" id="pgepubid00012"><a id="page_xvii" title="{xvii}"></a></span> place,</i> he
    <i>was like him; he is there—alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
        of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
        distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,
        to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at
        the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we
        possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
        draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The
        formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
        is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.
        Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the
        “miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain
        side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
        humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
        its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
        its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech
        or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
        with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions
        are historically true.</i></p>

<p><i>But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily
    exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
    figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like
    Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,
    perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
    very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible
    to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
    birth, as overbearing, as<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xviii}" id="pgepubid00013"><a id="page_xviii" title="{xviii}"></a></span> self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
    as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady
    Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
    rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
    developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
    themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even
    Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him
    for the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must
    always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
    or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
    the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
    except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
    the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
    consciously humorous kind—in the kind that we laugh with, not at—that
    even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is
    difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
    or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of
    the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
    consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,
    do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.
    Let us flatter ourselves that</i> I <i>may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
    to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just
    related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these
    pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xix}" id="pgepubid00014"><a id="page_xix" title="{xix}"></a></span> or are the
    result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s
    readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
    the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as
    they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction
    outside of these four.</i></p>

<p><i>The goodness of the minor characters in</i> Pride and Prejudice <i>has been
    already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
    difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have
    glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
    amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and
    Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
    differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
    vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
    weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has
    taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
    not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
    traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming
    her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of
    first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
    singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
    perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
    in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not
    to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and
    respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.
    Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xx}" id="pgepubid00015"><a id="page_xx" title="{xx}"></a></span> sometimes wish
    that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite
    these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe
    poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail.</i></p>

<p><i>The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de
    Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
    further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though
    delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between
    comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
    that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in
    dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in
    drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet
    not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with
    a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the
    hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed.</i></p>

<p><i>Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
    Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,
    whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
    comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is
    unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
    his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I
    cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which
    his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
    nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a</i> causa verior <i>for its
    sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s
    scornful refusal acting on a nature</i><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xxi}" id="pgepubid00016"><a id="page_xxi" title="{xxi}"></a></span> ex hypothesi <i>generous. Nothing in
    even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
    his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he
    been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
    under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
    husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the
    probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
    injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in
    love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
    phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
    only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
    charm.</i></p>

<p><i>The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen
    herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
    to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the</i>
    allegro <i>or</i> allegra <i>division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was
        always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
        except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
        sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
        about her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the
        lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever—almost
        strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word—and
        secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
        propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give
        at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
        “scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest
        obsoletenesses of phrase and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xxii}" id="pgepubid00017"><a id="page_xxii" title="{xxii}"></a></span> manner give one or two of her early
        speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
        serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,
        as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
        final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then
        too she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself
        or anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
        as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
        this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
        kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
        been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
        who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the
        injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
        aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world.</i></p>

<p><i>Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
    common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
    playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
    certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
    Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
    Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
    idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.
    Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing</i> viraginous, <i>nothing of the
    “New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
    women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
    that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{xxiii}" id="pgepubid00018"><a id="page_xxiii" title="{xxiii}"></a></span> away with
    her if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
    she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of
    passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so
    invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
    these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.
    But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
    married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and
    anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
    conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
    to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della
    Cruscans of this.</i></p>

<p><i>And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
    charm?—it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic
    exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In
    the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
    ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at
    least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
    help doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth
    Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara
    Grant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I
    should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana
    and Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one
    of the four can come into competition with Elizabeth.</i></p>

    Chapter I.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
    of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>

<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
    first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
    of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
    property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
    Netherfield Park is let at last?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{2}" id="pgepubid00023"><a id="page_2" title="{2}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
    told me all about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>

<p>“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>

            “He came down to see the place”<br/>
        </p>

        <p>[<i>Copyright 1894 by George Allen.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>This was invitation enough.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
    by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
    down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
    delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
    to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
    in the house by the end of next week.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{3}" id="pgepubid00024"><a id="page_3" title="{3}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“Bingley.”</p>

<p>“Is he married or single?”</p>

<p>“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
    five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p>

<p>“How so? how can it affect them?”</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You
    must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>

<p>“Is that his design in settling here?”</p>

<p>“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
    <i>may</i> fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
    soon as he comes.”</p>

<p>“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go—or you may send
    them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
    as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
    party.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty, but
    I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
    grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p>

<p>“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
    the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
    be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
    merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{4}" id="pgepubid00025"><a id="page_4" title="{4}"></a></span>
    comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit
    him, if you do not.”</p>

<p>“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
    glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
    hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls—though
    I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p>

<p>“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
    others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
    good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the preference.”</p>

<p>“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
    all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
    quickness than her sisters.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
    delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”</p>

<p>“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
    are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
    these twenty years at least.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</p>

<p>“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
    thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
    visit them.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
    all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
    reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
    been insufficient to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{5}" id="pgepubid00026"><a id="page_5" title="{5}"></a></span> make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
    was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,
    little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
    fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
    daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.</p>

    had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
    wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
    paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
    manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
    suddenly addressed her with,—</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p>

<p>“We are not in a way to know <i>what</i> Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,
    resentfully, “since we are not to visit.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{7}" id="pgepubid00029"><a id="page_7" title="{7}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
    assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
    of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
    of her.”</p>

<p>“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
    not depend on her serving you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
    herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p>

<p>“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little
    compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
    them ill.”</p>

<p>“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When
    is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
    the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
    she will not know him herself.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
    Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
    myself; how can you be so teasing?”</p>

<p>“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
    very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
    fortnight. But if <i>we</i> do not venture, somebody else will; and after
    all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{8}" id="pgepubid00030"><a id="page_8" title="{8}"></a></span>
    as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I
    will take it on myself.”</p>

<p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
    nonsense!”</p>

<p>“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
    you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
    them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <i>there</i>. What say you,
    Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
    great books, and make extracts.”</p>

<p>Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</p>

<p>“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
    Bingley.”</p>

<p>“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear <i>that</i>; but why did you not tell me so before? If I
    had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
    him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
    cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</p>

<p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished—that of Mrs.
    Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
    was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
    while.</p>

<p>“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
    persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
    neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a
    good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
    word about it till now.”</p>

<p>“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
    as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{9}" id="pgepubid00031"><a id="page_9" title="{9}"></a></span></p>

<p>“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
    shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
    or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so
    pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
    for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <i>are</i>
    the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
    ball.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I <i>am</i> the
    youngest, I’m the tallest.”</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
    return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
    dinner.</p>

    daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
    husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
    in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
    distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{11}"><a id="page_11" title="{11}"></a></span>
    last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
    Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
    delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
    agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
    with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
    dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
    hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</p>

<p>“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
    said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
    married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</p>

<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
    minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
    admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
    much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
    fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
    window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.</p>

<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
    Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
    housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
    was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
    accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
    disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
    so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
    he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
    settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
    little by starting the idea of his<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{12}" id="pgepubid00034"><a id="page_12" title="{12}"></a></span></p>

<p class="nind">being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
    report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
    seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a
    number of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{13}" id="pgepubid00035"><a id="page_13" title="{13}"></a></span> ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
    that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,
    his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
    assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his
    two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>

<p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
    countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
    with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
    looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
    of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
    the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
    his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
    pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
    much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
    admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
    which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
    proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
    large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
    disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
    friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
    people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
    was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
    himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
    themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
    only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
    introduced to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{14}" id="pgepubid00036"><a id="page_14" title="{14}"></a></span> any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
    walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
    His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
    the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
    Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
    his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
    having slighted one of her daughters.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
    down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
    standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
    Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
    friend to join it.</p>

<p>“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
    standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
    dance.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
    particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
    would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
    another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
    stand up with.”</p>

<p>“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a
    kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
    life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
    uncommonly pretty.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
    Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{15}" id="pgepubid00037"><a id="page_15" title="{15}"></a></span> But there is one
    of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
    dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption4">
    <img alt="[Image unavailable.]" src="2459739413955619883_i_044.jpg" id="id-967818403876824802"/>

        <p>[<i>Copyright 1894 by George Allen.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
    Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
    “She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me</i>; and I am in no
    humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
    by other men. You had better return to your<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{16}" id="pgepubid00038"><a id="page_16" title="{16}"></a></span> partner and enjoy her
    smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
    remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,
    however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
    playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</p>

<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
    Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
    party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
    distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her
    mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s
    pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
    accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
    fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
    had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
    spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
    were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
    book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
    good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
    such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
    views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
    had a very different story to hear.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
    delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
    Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
    she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
    her twice. Only think of <i>that</i>, my dear: he<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{17}" id="pgepubid00039"><a id="page_17" title="{17}"></a></span> actually danced with her
    twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
    time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
    up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
    can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
    down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
    asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss
    King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
    again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the <i>Boulanger</i>——”</p>

<p>“If he had had any compassion for <i>me</i>,” cried her husband impatiently,
    “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
    his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He
    is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
    in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
    lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown——”</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
    description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
    of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
    exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
    suiting <i>his</i> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
    all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
    him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
    great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
    dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{18}" id="pgepubid00040"><a id="page_18" title="{18}"></a></span>”</p>

    her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
    she admired him.</p>

<p>“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
    good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
    with such perfect good breeding!”</p>

<p>“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
    likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”</p>

<p>“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
    did not expect such a compliment.”</p>

<p>“Did not you? <i>I</i> did for you. But that is one great difference between
    us. Compliments always take <i>you</i> by surprise, and <i>me</i> never. What
    could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
    seeing that you<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{19}" id="pgepubid00042"><a id="page_19" title="{19}"></a></span> were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
    the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
    very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
    stupider person.”</p>

<p>“Dear Lizzy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
    You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
    in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”</p>

<p>“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
    what I think.”</p>

<p>“I know you do: and it is <i>that</i> which makes the wonder. With <i>your</i>
    good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
    others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
    everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,—to take the
    good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
    of the bad,—belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,
    too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
    converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
    his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
    neighbour in her.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
    the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
    quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
    with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
    very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine
    ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
    power<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{20}" id="pgepubid00043"><a id="page_20" title="{20}"></a></span> of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
    They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
    seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
    habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
    of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
    themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in
    the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
    memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
    acquired by trade.</p>

<p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
    thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
    but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
    sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
    good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
    who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
    remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
    purchase.</p>

<p>His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
    though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
    means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
    married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
    his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
    age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
    look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an
    hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
    with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</p>

<p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{21}" id="pgepubid00044"><a id="page_21" title="{21}"></a></span> friendship, in spite of a
    great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
    easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
    could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
    never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
    had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In
    understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
    deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
    reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
    inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
    was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually
    giving offence.</p>

<p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
    characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
    girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
    there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
    with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
    more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
    in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
    felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
    pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
    much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
    her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
    they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
    established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
    commendation to think of her as he chose.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{22}" id="pgepubid00045"><a id="page_22" title="{22}"></a></span></p>

    were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
    in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
    honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The
    distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a
    disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
    and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
    a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he
    could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
    business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,
    though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
    contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,
    friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
    courteous.</p>

<p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{23}" id="pgepubid00047"><a id="page_23" title="{23}"></a></span> clever to be a
    valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
    of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
    Elizabeth’s intimate friend.</p>

<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
    ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
    brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil
    self-command, to Miss Lucas. “<i>You</i> were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
    sure that <i>did</i> seem as if he admired her—indeed, I rather believe he
    <i>did</i>—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something
    about Mr. Robinson.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not
    I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
    assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
    women in the room, and <i>which</i> he thought the prettiest? and his
    answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,
    beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed—that does seem as
    if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> overhearings were more to the purpose than <i>yours</i>, Eliza,” said
    Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
    is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just <i>tolerable</i>.”</p>

<p>“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{24}" id="pgepubid00048"><a id="page_24" title="{24}"></a></span> vexed by his
    ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
    a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
    sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
    “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</p>

<p>“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{25}" id="pgepubid00049"><a id="page_25" title="{25}"></a></span> Netherfield, and he
    could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being
    spoke to.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless
    among his intimate acquaintance. With <i>them</i> he is remarkably
    agreeable.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
    agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
    was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
    heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come
    to the ball in a hack chaise.”</p>

<p>“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
    wish he had danced with Eliza.”</p>

<p>“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with <i>him</i>,
    if I were you.”</p>

<p>“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you <i>never</i> to dance with him.”</p>

<p>“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend <i>me</i> so much as pride
    often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
    very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
    should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <i>right</i>
    to be proud.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
    <i>his</i> pride, if he had not mortified <i>mine</i>.”</p>

<p>“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
    reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
    ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
    nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
    who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
    quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
    things, though the words are often<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{26}" id="pgepubid00050"><a id="page_26" title="{26}"></a></span> used synonymously. A person may be
    proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
    ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</p>

<p>“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his
    sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
    foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”</p>

<p>“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
    Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
    directly.”</p>

<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
    would; and the argument ended only with the visit.</p>

    was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
    good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
    found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
    a wish of being better acquainted with <i>them</i> was expressed towards the
    two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
    pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
    everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
    though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
    in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It
    was generally evident, whenever they met, that he <i>did</i> admire her; and
    to <i>her</i> it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
    which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
    way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
    was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
    united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
    uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{28}" id="pgepubid00053"><a id="page_28" title="{28}"></a></span> her from the
    suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss
    Lucas.</p>

<p>“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
    on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
    so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
    from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
    it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
    dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
    attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
    <i>begin</i> freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
    very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
    encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show <i>more</i>
    affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
    may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</p>

<p>“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If <i>I</i> can
    perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
    discover it too.”</p>

<p>“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”</p>

<p>“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
    it, he must find it out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
    meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
    always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
    every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
    therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
    attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
    in love as much as she chooses.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{29}" id="pgepubid00054"><a id="page_29" title="{29}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
    question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
    to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
    these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she
    cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
    reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
    dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
    and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
    enough to make her understand his character.”</p>

<p>“Not as you represent it. Had she merely <i>dined</i> with him, she might
    only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
    remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four
    evenings may do a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
    like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other
    leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
    she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
    chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
    twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
    the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
    ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
    least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
    have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
    possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
    life.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{30}" id="pgepubid00055"><a id="page_30" title="{30}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
    sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</p>

<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth
    was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
    interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
    allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
    ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
    sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
    hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
    uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
    this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
    detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
    in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
    pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
    of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
    this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
    himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
    to dance with.</p>

<p>He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
    with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
    drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
    assembled.</p>

<p>“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
    conversation with Colonel Forster?”</p>

<p>“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</p>

<p>“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see
    what he is about. He has a very<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{31}" id="pgepubid00056"><a id="page_31" title="{31}"></a></span> satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
    being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption6">
    <img alt="[Image unavailable.]" src="2459739413955619883_i_060.jpg" id="id-9167529082512536490"/>
    <div class="caption" id="ebm_caption6"><p>“The entreaties of several” [<i>Copyright 1894 by George
        Allen.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
    any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
    a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
    turned to him and said,—</p>

<p>“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
    just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
    Meryton?”</p>

<p>“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
    energetic.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{32}" id="pgepubid00057"><a id="page_32" title="{32}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“You are severe on us.”</p>

<p>“It will be <i>her</i> turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
    to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</p>

<p>“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me
    to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
    musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
    really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
    hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,
    she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
    at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
    of course familiar with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and
    I shall keep mine to swell my song.”</p>

<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
    or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
    would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
    sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
    the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
    impatient for display.</p>

<p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
    application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
    manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
    had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
    much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
    end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
    Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
    some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
    dancing at one end of the room.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{33}" id="pgepubid00058"><a id="page_33" title="{33}"></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
    passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
    much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
    was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:—</p>

<p>“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is
    nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first
    refinements of polished societies.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
    the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”</p>

<p>Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
    continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
    not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”</p>

<p>“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
    you often dance at St. James’s?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”</p>

<p>“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”</p>

<p>“You have a house in town, I conclude?”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy bowed.</p>

<p>“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of
    superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
    London would agree with Lady Lucas.”</p>

<p>He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
    make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
    struck with the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{34}" id="pgepubid00059"><a id="page_34" title="{34}"></a></span> notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
    her,—</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
    me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
    cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
    And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
    extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
    drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,—</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
    not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
    her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
    all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</p>

<p>“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
    the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
    amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
    for one half hour.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>

<p>“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
    cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
    partner?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
    her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
    complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,—</p>

<p>“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine not.”</p>

<p>“You are considering how insupportable it would be<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{35}" id="pgepubid00060"><a id="page_35" title="{35}"></a></span> to pass many
    evenings in this manner,—in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of
    your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
    noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
    people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”</p>

<p>“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
    agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
    which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”</p>

<p>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
    would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
    Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,—</p>

<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”</p>

<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
    How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you
    joy?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
    imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
    to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”</p>

<p>“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
    absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
    of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”</p>

<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
    entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
    that all was safe, her wit flowed along.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{36}" id="pgepubid00061"><a id="page_36" title="{36}"></a></span></p>

    thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
    in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
    fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
    the deficiency of his. Her father had been an<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{37}"><a id="page_37" title="{37}"></a></span> attorney in Meryton, and
    had left her four thousand pounds.</p>

<p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
    father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
    London in a respectable line of trade.</p>

<p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
    convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
    thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
    to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
    Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
    their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
    better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
    hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
    news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
    some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
    with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
    the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
    the head-quarters.</p>

<p>Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
    intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
    officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
    and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
    visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
    unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
    Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
    mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
    an ensign.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{38}" id="pgepubid00063"><a id="page_38" title="{38}"></a></span></p>

<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
    Bennet coolly observed,—</p>

<p>“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
    of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
    I am now convinced.”</p>

<p>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
    indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
    her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
    next morning to London.</p>

<p>“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
    ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
    of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”</p>

<p>“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”</p>

<p>“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
    had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
    so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
    foolish.”</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
    their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
    not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
    liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my
    heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
    should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
    Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in
    his regimentals.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{39}" id="pgepubid00064"><a id="page_39" title="{39}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
    Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first
    came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
    note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
    for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
    eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,—</p>

<p>“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
    Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”</p>

<p>“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"> “My dear friend,</p>

    <p>“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
        me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
        lives; for a whole day’s <i>tête-à-tête</i> between two women can never
        end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
        this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
        Yours ever,</p>

    <p class="r">
        “<span class="smcap">Caroline Bingley</span>.”<br/>
    </p></div>

<p>“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
    <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”</p>

<p>“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
    rain; and then you must stay all night.”</p>

<p>“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
    they would not offer to send her home.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{40}" id="pgepubid00065"><a id="page_40" title="{40}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;
    and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</p>

<p>“I had much rather go in the coach.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
    wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption7">
    <img alt="[Image unavailable.]" src="2459739413955619883_i_069.jpg" id="id-5301694597105999414"/>
    <div class="caption" id="ebm_caption7"><p>Cheerful prognostics</p></div>
</div>

<p>“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</p>

<p>“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
    will be answered.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{41}" id="pgepubid00066"><a id="page_41" title="{41}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
    were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
    mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
    day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
    rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
    delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
    Jane certainly could not come back.</p>

<p>“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than
    once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
    morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
    contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
    brought the following note for Elizabeth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">“My dearest Lizzie,</p>

    <p>“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
        imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
        not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
        my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
        of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and a
        headache, there is not much the matter with me.</p>

    <p class="r">
        “Yours, etc.”<br/>
    </p></div>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
    aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she
    should die—it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
    Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{42}" id="pgepubid00067"><a id="page_42" title="{42}"></a></span> not die of little
    trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
    there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the
    carriage.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
    carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
    her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>

<p>“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
    thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
    there.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”</p>

<p>“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
    horses?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
    when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”</p>

<p>“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
    impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
    exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”</p>

<p>“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
    Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
    together.</p>

<p>“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
    see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”</p>

<p>In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
    of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
    field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
    over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
    within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
    glowing with the warmth of exercise.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{43}" id="pgepubid00068"><a id="page_43" title="{43}"></a></span></p>

<p>She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
    assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
    That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
    dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
    Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
    for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
    brother’s manners there was something better than politeness—there was
    good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
    nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
    brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
    the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
    thinking only of his breakfast.</p>

<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
    Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
    enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
    immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
    alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
    for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
    however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,
    could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
    extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
    her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption8">
    <img alt="[Image unavailable.]" src="2459739413955619883_i_073.jpg" id="id-5933389723673640946"/>
    <div class="caption" id="ebm_caption8"><p>
        “The Apothecary came”<br/>
    </p></div>
</div>

<p>When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
    began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
    solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having
    examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
    violent cold, and that they must endeavour to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{44}" id="pgepubid00069"><a id="page_44" title="{44}"></a></span> get the better of it;
    advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
    was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
    ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
    the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
    nothing to do elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
    unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
    wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
    at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
    of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
    present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
    despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
    back a supply of clothes.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="A" src="2459739413955619883_i_074_b.png" id="id-5898497888039664123"/></span>T five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
    Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
    poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
    much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very
    favourable answer.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{46}"><a id="page_46" title="{46}"></a></span> Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
    this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
    shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
    being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
    indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored
    Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.</p>

<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
    regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
    attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
    herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
    others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
    engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
    Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
    eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
    dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
    began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
    pronounced to be very bad indeed,—a mixture of pride and impertinence:
    she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
    thought the same, and added,—</p>

<p>“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
    walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
    looked almost wild.”</p>

<p>“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
    nonsensical to come at all! Why must <i>she</i> be scampering about the
    country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{47}" id="pgepubid00072"><a id="page_47" title="{47}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
    in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
    hide it not doing its office.”</p>

<p>“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
    all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well
    when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
    escaped my notice.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
    inclined to think that you would not wish to see <i>your sister</i> make such
    an exhibition.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
    above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
    it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
    a most country-town indifference to decorum.”</p>

<p>“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
    Bingley.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
    “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
    eyes.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
    short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,—</p>

<p>“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,—she is really a very sweet
    girl,—and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
    a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
    chance of it.”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
    Meryton?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{48}" id="pgepubid00073"><a id="page_48" title="{48}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”</p>

<p>“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“If they had uncles enough to fill <i>all</i> Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
    would not make them one jot less agreeable.”</p>

<p>“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
    consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.</p>

<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
    hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
    their dear friend’s vulgar relations.</p>

<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
    leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
    She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
    late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
    when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
    down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
    party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
    them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
    excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
    below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”</p>

<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
    reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”</p>

<p>“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{49}" id="pgepubid00074"><a id="page_49" title="{49}"></a></span> Elizabeth; “I
    am <i>not</i> a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”</p>

<p>“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
    I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
    where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
    others; all that his library afforded.</p>

<p>“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
    credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more
    than I ever looked into.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
    in the room.</p>

<p>“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
    so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
    Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”</p>

<p>“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many
    generations.”</p>

<p>“And then you have added so much to it yourself—you are always buying
    books.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
    these.”</p>

<p>“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
    that noble place. Charles, when you build <i>your</i> house, I wish it may be
    half as delightful as Pemberley.”</p>

<p>“I wish it may.”</p>

<p>“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
    neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
    finer county in England than Derbyshire.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{50}" id="pgepubid00075"><a id="page_50" title="{50}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”</p>

<p>“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
    Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
    attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
    the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
    sister, to observe the game.</p>

<p>“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will
    she be as tall as I am?”</p>

<p>“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
    rather taller.”</p>

<p>“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
    so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
    for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”</p>

<p>“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
    to be so very accomplished as they all are.”</p>

<p>“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
    net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am
    sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
    being informed that she was very accomplished.”</p>

<p>“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
    too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
    otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very
    far<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{51}" id="pgepubid00076"><a id="page_51" title="{51}"></a></span> from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
    cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
    acquaintance that are really accomplished.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.</p>

<p>“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
    idea of an accomplished woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
    esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
    with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
    dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
    this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
    walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
    will be but half deserved.”</p>

<p>“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add
    something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
    reading.”</p>

<p>“I am no longer surprised at your knowing <i>only</i> six accomplished women.
    I rather wonder now at your knowing <i>any</i>.”</p>

<p>“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
    this?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> never saw such a woman. <i>I</i> never saw such capacity, and taste, and
    application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
    implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
    answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{52}" id="pgepubid00077"><a id="page_52" title="{52}"></a></span>
    bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
    conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
    room.</p>

<p>“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
    one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
    sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it
    succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
    “there is meanness in <i>all</i> the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
    to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
    despicable.”</p>

<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
    continue the subject.</p>

<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
    that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for
    immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
    be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
    eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
    unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
    that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
    were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
    declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
    however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
    his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every

    morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
    inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
    and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
    sisters. In spite of this amendment,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{54}"><a id="page_54" title="{54}"></a></span> however, she requested to have a
    note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
    own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and
    its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
    two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>

<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
    very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
    not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
    restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
    would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
    home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
    it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
    Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
    attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
    that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
    moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
    a little longer on your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
    sure, will not hear of her removal.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
    “that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
    remains with us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not
    know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
    vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
    always<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{55}" id="pgepubid00080"><a id="page_55" title="{55}"></a></span> the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
    temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
    <i>her</i>. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
    over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
    equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
    hope, though you have but a short lease.”</p>

<p>“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
    should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
    minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh yes—I understand you perfectly.”</p>

<p>“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
    through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”</p>

<p>“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
    intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
    the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”</p>

<p>“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were
    a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but intricate characters are the <i>most</i> amusing. They have at
    least that advantage.”</p>

<p>“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
    such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
    unvarying society.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{56}" id="pgepubid00081"><a id="page_56" title="{56}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
    observed in them for ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
    country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of <i>that</i>
    going on in the country as in town.”</p>

<p>Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
    turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
    victory over him, continued her triumph,—</p>

<p>“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
    my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
    pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”</p>

<p>“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
    when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their
    advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that
    gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
    at all.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
    mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
    such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
    you must acknowledge to be true.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
    many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
    neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”</p>

<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
    countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
    Mr. Darcy with a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{57}" id="pgepubid00082"><a id="page_57" title="{57}"></a></span> very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
    saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
    Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since <i>her</i> coming away.</p>

<p>“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
    William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
    genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. <i>That</i>
    is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
    important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”</p>

<p>“Did Charlotte dine with you?”</p>

<p>“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
    my part, Mr. Bingley, <i>I</i> always keep servants that can do their own
    work; <i>my</i> daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to
    judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
    assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that <i>I</i> think
    Charlotte so <i>very</i> plain; but then she is our particular friend.”</p>

<p>“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
    has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
    of my own child; but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody
    better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
    partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
    brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
    sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
    But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
    wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{58}" id="pgepubid00083"><a id="page_58" title="{58}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has
    been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
    discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”</p>

<p>“I have been used to consider poetry as the <i>food</i> of love,” said Darcy.</p>

<p>“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
    strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
    am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”</p>

<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
    tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
    speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
    Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
    Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
    unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
    civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,
    indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
    soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
    her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
    each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
    youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
    into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>

<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
    and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
    affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
    animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
    attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{59}" id="pgepubid00084"><a id="page_59" title="{59}"></a></span> dinners and her
    own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
    very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
    ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
    the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer
    to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
    your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
    the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”</p>

<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes—it would be much better to
    wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter
    would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <i>your</i> ball,” she
    added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
    Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
    instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
    remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
    could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <i>her</i>, in spite of
    all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on <i>fine eyes</i>.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{60}" id="pgepubid00085"><a id="page_60" title="{60}"></a></span></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00086"><a id="CHAPTER_X"/><img alt="" src="2459739413955619883_i_089_a.jpg" id="id-2274828552505620895"/>

    CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="T" src="2459739413955619883_i_089_b.png" id="id-3839909118159575280"/></span>HE day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
    Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
    continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined
    their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
    Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
    the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
    messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
    Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>

<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
    attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
    commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
    of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
    with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
    exactly in unison with her opinion of each.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{61}" id="pgepubid00087"><a id="page_61" title="{61}"></a></span></p>

<p>“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>“You write uncommonly fast.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”</p>

<p>“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
    year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”</p>

<p>“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
    pens remarkably well.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”</p>

<p>“How can you contrive to write so even?”</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
    and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
    little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
    Grantley’s.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
    present I have not room to do them justice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
    always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”</p>

<p>“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
    to determine.”</p>

<p>“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
    ease cannot write ill.”</p>

<p>“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
    brother, “because he does <i>not</i> write with ease.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{62}" id="pgepubid00088"><a id="page_62" title="{62}"></a></span> He studies too much
    for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”</p>

<p>“My style of writing is very different from yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
    imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”</p>

<p>“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which
    means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”</p>

<p>“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
    humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
    indirect boast.”</p>

<p>“And which of the two do you call <i>my</i> little recent piece of modesty?”</p>

<p>“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
    writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
    thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
    think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
    quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
    attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
    Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
    you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
    panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
    laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
    undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
    foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
    believed what I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{63}" id="pgepubid00089"><a id="page_63" title="{63}"></a></span> said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
    moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
    precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
    would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
    dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
    mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay
    till next week,’ you would probably do it—you would probably not
    go—and, at another word, might stay a month.”</p>

<p>“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
    not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
    more than he did himself.”</p>

<p>“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
    friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
    afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
    intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
    circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
    could.”</p>

<p>“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
    as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter—Darcy must speak for
    himself.”</p>

<p>“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
    but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
    stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
    that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{64}" id="pgepubid00090"><a id="page_64" title="{64}"></a></span> and
    the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
    one argument in favour of its propriety.”</p>

<p>“To yield readily—easily—to the <i>persuasion</i> of a friend is no merit
    with you.”</p>

<p>“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
    either.”</p>

<p>“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
    friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
    one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
    one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
    supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
    circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
    thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
    where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
    very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
    with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”</p>

<p>“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
    with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
    appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
    between the parties?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
    forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
    weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
    you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
    myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
    know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{65}" id="pgepubid00091"><a id="page_65" title="{65}"></a></span>
    particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
    when he has nothing to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
    rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
    resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
    brother for talking such nonsense.</p>

<p>“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
    and want to silence this.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
    Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
    thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”</p>

<p>“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
    Darcy had much better finish his letter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>

<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
    for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
    the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the
    way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
    seated herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
    Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
    that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
    on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
    admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
    he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
    at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
    more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
    any other person present.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{66}" id="pgepubid00092"><a id="page_66" title="{66}"></a></span> The supposition did not pain her. She liked
    him too little to care for his approbation.</p>

<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
    lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
    Elizabeth, said to her,—</p>

<p>“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
    opportunity of dancing a reel?”</p>

<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
    surprise at her silence.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately
    determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
    that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
    delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
    their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
    you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
    dare.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not dare.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
    gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
    manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had
    never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
    believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
    should be in some danger.</p>

<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
    anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
    assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
    their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{67}" id="pgepubid00093"><a id="page_67" title="{67}"></a></span> the shrubbery the
    next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
    desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
    and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
    the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
    check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
    which your lady possesses.”</p>
